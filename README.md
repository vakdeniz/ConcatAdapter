Hello,

I just creted the project for experiencing and explaining how to create the complicated list UI with ConcatAdapter easily. 

Basically I created CustomConcatAdapter and decided layoutManager of childRecyclerView with ViewType.

You can find more details about the project on my Medium post: https://medium.com/@vakdeniz/concatadapter-mergedadapter-with-multiple-ui-types-9cab955dae4d

Regards,
Veli
